To run the simulation:

Ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your system.
Save the provided Python scripts (agent1.py, agent2.py, environment.py, and run.py) in the same directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the files, and execute:
bash
Copy code
python run.py
The simulation will display a grid with tasks (red squares) and barriers (black squares). Two buttons allow you to start simulations with Agent1 (A)* or Agent2 (UCS):
Click on the A Search* button to start Agent1's simulation.
Click on the UCS Search button to start Agent2's simulation.
The agents will navigate the grid to complete tasks while avoiding barriers.
